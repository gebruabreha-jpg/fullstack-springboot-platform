# Notes Management API
A simple Notes Management REST API built with **FastAPI** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.
This project is part of a daily backend coding challenge series focused on improving API development and OOP design skills.

## API Endpoints

### Create Note
**POST** `/notes`
Request body:
```json
{
  "title": "Learn FastAPI",
  "content": "Today I learned routing and dependency injection",
  "tags": ["python", "fastapi"]
}
```
Response:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Learn FastAPI",
  "content": "Today I learned routing and dependency injection",
  "tags": ["python", "fastapi"]
}
```

---
### Get All Notes
**GET** `/notes`
Returns all notes.
---
### Search Notes
**GET** `/notes/search?q=python`
Searches notes by:
* title
* content
* tags

---

### Delete Note
**DELETE** `/notes/{id}`
Deletes a note by ID.
Example:
```plaintext
DELETE /notes/1
```
---

## OOP Design
### Note Class
Represents a single note object.
Attributes:

* `id`
* `title`
* `content`
* `tags`

---

### NoteManager Class
Handles all business logic:
* create note
* fetch notes
* search notes
* delete notes

This keeps API routes clean and separates logic from HTTP handling.

---

## Future Improvements
* Add update note endpoint
* Add SQLite/PostgreSQL support
* Add authentication
* Add timestamps
* Add pagination
* Add tag filtering

---
## Learning Goals

This project helps practice:
* Object-Oriented Programming
* REST API development
* CRUD operations
* Search/filtering logic
* FastAPI fundamentals

async / await in Python:-
It's a way to write concurrent code without threads. Instead of blocking on I/O (database, HTTP calls, file reads), the program pauses and lets other tasks run while waiting.

Use async when I/O-bound, threads when CPU-bound. For a notes API, async is the standard choice. Threading is rarely needed unless you're doing heavy computation.
